### Gentle Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning
This collection of notebooks aims to recapitulate the most popular supervised ML methods for tabular data. Each notebook presents different algorithms with an easily understandable definition of their strengths and limitations. These notebooks can be found at [github.com/albergar2](https://github.com/albergar2/data_science_material/tree/master/ML/supervised).
